# Look for the potential signs of CVE-2019-0708, pre encryption.
#
# Note this rule is specific to port 3389, but could be expanded
# using flowbits to other ports if an earlier packet is used for
# protocol detection, or potentially a string detection on 'Duca'
# (see https://wiki.wireshark.org/RDP).
#
# Sensible values for distances between objects have been chosen.
# An exploit could potentially change the reserved byte (second 
# in the packet) or pad the TPKT structure with junk to avoid the
# 'within' optimisations.
#
# 03 00                - TPKT header: version 3, reserved byte 0
#                        Must be at the beginning of the packet
# 02 f0                - X.224 COTP: length 2, PDU type 0x0f (DT_DATA)
# 00 05 00 14 7c 00 01 - T.124 Connect data, Generic Conference Control (ID 0.0.20.124.0.1)
#                        PDU size ranges from 230-400 bytes, 256 skipped in the rule
# 03 c0                - RDP Client Network Data
#                        Skip the header length and channel count (6 bytes)
# MS_T120 (C string)   - Name of patched control channel
#                        Must be within 372 bytes (31 channels * 12 bytes per channel)
